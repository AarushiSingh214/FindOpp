Final App Design Project - README Template

# Final App Idea
1. An app that allows students to find opportunities based on their year, field or location. For example, a student could say they are a junior in high school interested in the field of computer science and location could be US. So then it could list all of the internships, programs, camps that are offered. And if you want a more specific location then it could find more opportunities in your local area.

## Overview
### Description 
For example, a student could say they are a junior in high school interested in the field of computer science and location could be US. So then it could list all of the internships, programs, camps that are offered. And if you want a more specific location then it could, find more opportunities in your local area. If you like an opportunitiy, then you could click it to get more information(specific location, money...). Maybe you could write a review on the program(extra).   

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Opportunities
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential so that users can easily find the opportunities that they are interested in. 
- **Story:** Allows users to find the extracurricular opportunities in the area they are looking for depending on age, field ad location
- **Market:** High schoolers who are finding opportunities in their field of interest.
- **Habit:** People would be using this app constantly when trying to find opportunities for themselves whether that's in the summer or year round.
- **Scope:** V1 would be the sign up or login page. V2 would be the page you get taken to depending on if you click sign up or login. V3 could be a get started page where you have to enter your year in high school, age, field of interest, location your looking for opportunities in, and when you're looking for these opportunities(summer, all year). V4 could show you all of the opportunities that are available to you and there could be a star feature so if you like an opportunity it will be added to your favorities in that folder. V5 couldd maybe be like folders that contain all of the fields and then when you click on the folder, inside is all of the favorities that you liked. So if you have another area that your interested in, then it would make another folder. V6 is if you like a folder than you can click on an opportunity and get more information.
